  <h1>MARY PAIGE HUISMAN</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

  <!--About Me Section-->
  <p>I am a Florida native and mom of one looking to change my career. I previously have worked in the
    hospitality industry since 2014 and am not looking to switch into the world of programming. I love
    the customer service aspect of hospitality and would love to bring that passion for people to my code. 
    I currently reside in Parrish, FL just North of Bradenton and love to work remote but am open to hybrid 
    work within the area. 
  </p>
  <p>I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am currently working to learn back end programs like React
    with goals of being a full stack engineer. I have worked through courses on FreeCodeCamp and CodeCademy. Below
    is a snap shot of my previous work experience in the hospitality industry.
